  <h2>CXJSTerm Demo</h2><br>
    <p>This is a project designed to offer an enviornment for testing JavaScript and JS related code in a way that centers around the look and feel of a linux terminal enviornment. It is not a linux terminal emulator, nor does it have a lot of the functionality of one, but it is designed to work well with small JavaScript programming projects that may just need to have a function or two tested, without creating a whole new webpage to load it on. </p>
